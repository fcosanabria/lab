Here is bit of boilerplate for dockering a Flask application. This is a simple example of how to create a Docker image for a Flask application. The image is based on the official Python image, and it uses the Flask web framework to serve a simple "Hello, World!" message in the browser.

## Usage

For building the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t flask-docker .
```
 
For running the Docker container, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-docker
```

Remember that you can change the `flask-docker` name for the image and the container to whatever you want.

You are going to have some Celery errors, but you can ignore them for now. This is just a simple example of how to create a Docker image for a Flask application.
